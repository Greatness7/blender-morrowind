Downloading
===========


Requirements
------------

- **Blender 3.6 (64-bit)** or newer. Available on the `official Blender download page`_. Note that this plugin is not compatible with 32-bit builds of Blender!
- **Windows Users** will need the `Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Redistributable (x64)`_ package. You may already have this on your system, but running the executable is safe and highly recommended.

Recommendations
---------------

- **Unpacked BSA files** will be necessary if you intend to view or edit the original Morrowind art assets. Textures inside BSAs are not accessible to Blender and will not be rendered in the viewport. There are several tools, such as the `Bethesda Archive Extractor`_, that can be used to unpack your BSAs.
- **NifSkope 1.1.3** is a dedicated tool for viewing and low level editing of NIF assets. While not suitable for general modeling, NifSkope will prove invaluable for verifying and tweaking the results of your Blender exports. Download from the `NifSkope releases page`_.
