The standard way to install is via Blender's ``Edit->Preferences->Add-ons`` interface. Pressing the ``Install`` button there will bring up a file-select window where you can select the ``io_scene_mw.zip`` archive that you acquired in the :ref:`Downloading` section.

For more information, see the `Add-ons`_ page of the Blender manual.

Manual Install
--------------

If the standard install method is not working on your system, you can also install the plugin manually. Simply extract the ``io_scene_mw.zip`` archive into your Blender's ``/scripts/addons/`` directory. The location of this directory varies between platforms, so check `Directory Layout`_ page of the Blender manual for more information. A correct directory layout *after* extraction should have ``/scripts/addons/io_scene_mw/__init__.py`` (and various other files from the plugin archive).
